# evolution
How does evolution work? I mean, how can a random unplanned process develop a unique organ such as an eye?
Inspired by [Primer YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzJFdi57J53Vr_BkTfN3uQ) I created a simple ecosystem 
in which creatures are born, age, replicate and die to examine how a mutation is retained (or lost) because of changing
conditions.

# Simulation
This program simulates an ecosystem that has time, 2D space, food & creatures.
It produces a simple (too simple, perhaps) report to show what happens over time

## Time
Time is divided into turns. Each turn a food may replicate, a creature performs an action or die.

## 2d Space
